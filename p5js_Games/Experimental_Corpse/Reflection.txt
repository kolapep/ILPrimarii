Reflection:

Part one of this assignment might have been  exacuted a little differetly than my classmates or what the instructions called for. I was missing for last week's class and was unable to get in contact with any classmates that didn't already have partners for this weeks assignment. 

Instead, I played the game with a few of my friends and asked them to design simple monsters with backstories for me. I resketched their drawings onto a readable page and then constructed my final monster with the outline sheet given. 

I decided to go simple with the colors (black and white) and focused on using stokeweight to replicate lineweight of inking in tradtiional media.


I honestly struggled in figuring out how to effeciently utilize the custom functions for this assignment at first, even though i've used these funtions in past submissions. It was especially challenging because my sketch had a lot of round shapes and rotations. 

I ended up simplifying the drawing into 6 primary shapes via sketch before scripting and plugging them into functions. From there a simply painstakingly copied and paster until the drawing was done
