The data I chose to track for my project was the amount of love songs I listen too on Spotify. I chose to visually represent the percentage by day of the week

The percentage is represented by the size of the bar
The day of the week is represented by the color

DATA:

Sunday: 59%
Monday: 36%
Tuesday: 25%
Wednesday: 39%
Thursday: 38%
Friday: 15%
Saturday: 39%
