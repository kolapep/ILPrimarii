My Illusion is based on one of the most simple fundementals in color theory=
red + blue = purple.
I was also inspired by an old school screen layout and glitch effects

By rapidly changing blue and a mix of red shades, this creates the illusion of a purple screen.

PROCESS

I don't have a lot of background or explination for my process. It was a lot of blind try and fail with about a hundred small adjustments to colors and sizes of the pattern. In the future I wwould have made more colors.
