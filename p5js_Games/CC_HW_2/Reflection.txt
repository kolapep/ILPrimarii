I first started with the background. I attempted to recreate a cammo effect by stacking layers of black ovals with a lower opacity.
I added a drop shadow behind the main blue base circle with a black elipse- low opasity
I added a shadow on the blue circle base
I could not figure out how to do a radial gradient (TRUST ME I TRIED) so I tried to recreate via circles
The rest of my process was relativly strightfoward- shape, fill, no stoke, color, transform, copy paste repeat. I had to ask my partner about a few instructions but other alterations were made after the image started to come though
Halfway through I was hit by the realization that I was doing rotation before translation meaning all my translations had been skewed- made the process much faster after the fix - lesson learned
Last I added a shine overtop with a lowered opacity
